  abstract = {Move over native apps. New progressive web apps have capabilities that will soon make you obsolete. With this hands-on guide, web developers and business execs will learn how--and why--to develop web apps that take advantage of features that have so far been exclusive to native apps. Features that include fast load times, push notifications, offline access, homescreen shortcuts, and an entirely app-like experience. By leveraging the latest browser APIs, progressive web apps combine all of the benefits of native apps, while avoiding their issues. Throughout the book, author Tal Ater shows you how to improve a simple website for the fictional Gotham Imperial Hotel into a modern progressive web app. Plus:Understand how service workers work, and use them to create sites that launch in an instant, regardless of the user's internet connection. Create full-screen web apps that launch from the phone's homescreen just like native apps. Re-engage users with push notifications, even days after they have left your site. Embrace offline-first and build web apps that gracefully handle loss of connectivity. Explore new UX opportunities and challenges presented by progressive web apps},

  abstract = {Current web platform and browsers are adequately powerful to support mobile and  desktop applications. Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that support the integration  of mobile device and web browsers can execute features such as notifications, push  messages, home screen icon, device camera and so on. The concept of progressive web apps is to make regular websites functional as mobile and desktop app, without compromising the user experience of traditionally used native apps. In order to  understand the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), a functional app was created  using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with the manifest file, service workers, and web  APIs.  
 
The primary objective of the thesis was to understand and implement the technologies  of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Hence, a detailed study of the topic and  development of a PWA was also carried out. The study showed that one PWA could  serve the function of a website, mobile app and a desktop app efficiently. On one hand,  the technology used for making a PWA is not too complicated for web developers using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and on the other hand, simple files can turn an existing  HTTPS website into a fully functional app, saving the cost of developing a new native app.},

The term was coined and defined in 2001 by Frank Robinson, and then popularized by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.
It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.},
