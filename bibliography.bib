Although it is great that these are finally supported, the user experience of Progressive Web Applications on iOS is still not perfect.},

  shorttitle = {Progressive {{Web Applications}}({{PWAs}})},
  abstract = {Current web platform and browsers are adequately powerful to support mobile and  desktop applications. Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that support the integration  of mobile device and web browsers can execute features such as notifications, push  messages, home screen icon, device camera and so on. The concept of progressive web apps is to make regular websites functional as mobile and desktop app, without compromising the user experience of traditionally used native apps. In order to  understand the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), a functional app was created  using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with the manifest file, service workers, and web  APIs.

The primary objective of the thesis was to understand and implement the technologies  of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Hence, a detailed study of the topic and  development of a PWA was also carried out. The study showed that one PWA could  serve the function of a website, mobile app and a desktop app efficiently. On one hand,  the technology used for making a PWA is not too complicated for web developers using  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and on the other hand, simple files can turn an existing  HTTPS website into a fully functional app, saving the cost of developing a new native app.},
