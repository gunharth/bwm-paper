\textbf{Abstract}


The primary objective of this study is to understand and implement the technologies of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs).
As part of this research an existing native mobile application was selected, re-build and deployed as a PWA. For the frontend of the application I am using Vue.js. Firebase was selected as the provider for the backend. Based on this, I discuss the requirements of the original application and demonstrate on how these were implemented using PWA specific technologies and techniques. The results indicate that PWAs have become a strong competitor in the app development market.
